<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I am committed to safeguarding the privacy of my website visitors. This policy applies where I am acting as a
    data controller with respect to the personal data of my website visitors; in other words, where I determine
    the purposes and means of the processing of that personal data.
<p>In this policy, "I", "me" and "my" refer to Thomas Berchtold. For more information about me, see

</p>

<h2>How I use your personal data</h2>

<p> I may process data which is available in the raw logfiles provided by my hosting service provider
    <a href="https://www.cyon.ch/legal/impressum">Cyon GmbH</a>. These raw logfiles are indispensable

    of resolving technical issues with my hosting service provider. There are no further analysis conducted
    based on these raw log files. The raw log files include your IP address, date and time of access,
    requested URL, HTTP status code, referral source, amount of transferred data, the browser type
    and version and the used operating system.

<p>I may process information that you post to publish or to comment on my website ("publication data"). The
    publication data may be processed for the purposes of enabling such publication and administering my
    website. The legal basis for this processing is consent (by accepting the terms when sending a comment or
    publication).</p>

<p> I may process information contained in any communications that you send to me by email or through my
    website, including its communication content and metadata. The information data may be processed for the
    purposes of handling such communication.</p>

    exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court

    assertion of my legal rights, your legal rights and the legal rights of others.</p>

<p>I may process any of your personal data identified in this policy where necessary for the purposes of
    managing risks, or obtaining professional advice. The legal basis for this processing is my legitimate
    interests, namely the proper protection of my business against risks.
</p>

<p> In addition to the specific purposes for which I may process your personal data set out in this Section, I
    may also process any of your personal data where such processing is necessary for compliance with a legal
    obligation to which I am subject, or in order to protect your vital interests or the vital interests of
    another natural person.
