My personal blog with my experiences and learnings as a software engineer.

This repository contains the templates, assets, markdown and ascidoc documents to generate the homepage with Jekyll. The homepage itself can be accessed under [https://thesystemicprogrammer.org](https://thesystemicprogrammer.org).
